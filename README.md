# MBHS Robotics Segway 2018

This project aims to revive the old segway made in 2010 by switching out the VEX Cortex that used to control the segway with a Raspberry Pi. The benefits of this are that the RasPi is significantly smaller, cheaper, easier to work with, and more compatible with accessories. We started the project with a steel frame for the segway, two old wheelchair motors and wheels, and two Victor 883 Motor Controllers for each motor. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
motorSignals.ino is arduino code. 
Server.py is meant to be run on a raspberry pi
```

```
To run it, simply compile the arduino code onto some arduino and run
python Server.py
```
## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

Needs an accelerometer and magnetometer sensor on an Android phone

## Future Work

The segway can be improved by redoing the electrical components
